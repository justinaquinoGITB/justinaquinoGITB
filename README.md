Check out:
[Mneme Space Combat]([url](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/434090/Mneme-Space-Combat-full?src=hottest_filtered)) - updated Space Combat for Cepheus Engine to fix the gaps (like movement rules) and mechanics needed to make space combat complete. It comes with Ship maps, stats, spreadsheets for ship generation, and Blender models of the ship so you can customize it. The full PDF is available in the Preview with watermark (buying it has no watermark or any DRM). It comes with all its editable files.
