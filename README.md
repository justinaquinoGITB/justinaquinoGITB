[Mneme Space Combat](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/434090/Mneme-Space-Combat-full?src=hottest_filtered) - updated Space Combat for Cepheus Engine to fix the gaps (like movement rules) and mechanics needed to make space combat complete. It comes with Ship maps, stats, spreadsheets for ship generation, and Blender models of the ship so you can customize it.

[Mneme World Generator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/403824/MNEME-World-Generator?src=hottest_filtered). Instead of generating a planet, these rules make Star Systems and all the significant elements. Instead of spending a lot of time - we made it a spreadsheet for 1 click creation. It includes blender models of planets, a procedural planet generator and 2D map generator

[Mneme Variant Combat Rules](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/358701/Mneme-Variant-Combat-Rules?src=hottest_filtered). These rules streamlines combat so the Referee can run with more elements. It includes Career Cards, and it will include the full working version of Cepheus Engine Character generator when completed. It includes a spreadsheet to manage all the equipment if you want to detail a lot of multi-TL equipment.
